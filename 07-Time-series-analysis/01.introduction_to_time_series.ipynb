    "Time series:  A sequence of data points over time. It is used to analyze and forecast future values based on past observations.\n",
    "## Components of Time Series \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time**: The variable representing the time at which an event or data point is recorded. It's usually in a continuous format,- A time series is a sequence of data points.\n",
    "2. **Time series data**: A sequence of observations recorded over time, where each observation is associated with time.\n",
    "3. **Trend**:  A trend component represents a long-term pattern or tendency in the data series over time, such as an overall increase or decrease in the valuel.\n",
    "4. **seasonality**:  recurring pattern that repeats over a fixed time period, such as daily or weekly cycles. Examples include sales data peaking on Christmas.\n",
    "5. **cyclic pattern**:    A cycle is a complete loop through all the data points in a time series. It consists of one or more periods, where each period has a specific- \n",
    "6. **Randomness**:  In time series analysis, randomness is the lack of structure or pattern in data. It means that each data point is independent of the previous or following data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms of Time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **stationarity**: A time series is said to be stationary if the statistical properties of the data are constant over time.\n",
    "7. **Auto correlation**:  Measure of a time series b/w a variable current and past time values. It shows how much the value at a particular point.\n",
    "8. **Lag**: A lag refers to the time interval between two related observations in a time series dataset.\n",
    "9. **Moving Average**:       It is an average of a fixed number of previous data points, used for smoothing out fluctuations It represents how far back in time we need to It represents how much time or distance separates one It is used to capture any temporal dependencies or patterns.\n",
    "10 **ARIMA**: (Autoregressive intergrated MOving Averages)  is an approach used for forecasting future values of a time series based on past values. \n",
    "11 **Forecasting**:  The process of predicting future values based on past data based on the time.\n",
    "12. **Outlier**:     An outlier is an observation that deviates significantly from other observationin a dataset.\n",
