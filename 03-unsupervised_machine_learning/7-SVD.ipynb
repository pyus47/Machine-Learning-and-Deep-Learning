    "\n",
    "1. svd is a technique of unsupervised learning used for dimensionality reduction, noise reduction and data compression.\n",
    "2. it is used for data filtering.\n",
    "3. svd is a linear algebara method that is used to decompose bigger matrix into smaller one.\n",
    "4. It break higher dimensional data into lower dimensional data.Thus it saves memory and resource optimization.\n",
    "## Orthogonal matrix:\n",
    "A high dimensional matrix is broken down into two square matrix called orthogonal matrix and one diagonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Latent variable\n",
    "A latent variable is a variable that can't be observed directly.it can infered or conceptualize by measuring other measureable variables.\n",
